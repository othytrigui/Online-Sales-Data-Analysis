## Tasks Performed

Handled missing data
Verified and cleaned transaction dates
Conducted descriptive statistics
Identified the month with the most sales
Visualized data using bar charts
Segmented customers into LRFM groups

## Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

## Key Findings

Customers can be segmented into five distinct LRFM groups:
LRFM: Highly valuable customers with frequent, recent purchases and high spending
lrFm: Low lifetime value, infrequent purchases, older purchases, low spending
LRfm: High lifetime value, infrequent purchases, recent purchases, low spending
lRfm: Low lifetime value, infrequent purchases, recent purchases, low spending
lrfm: Least valuable customers with infrequent, older purchases and low spending

## Recommendations

Focus on retaining LRFM customers through loyalty programs and special offers
Improve customer experience to convert other segments to LRFM
Develop targeted offers for lrFm and lrfm segments to increase their value
