# Online Sales Data Analysis

## Description

This project analyzes online sales data to understand customer behavior and segment them into different groups using the LRFM model.

## Tasks Performed

- Loaded and merged datasets from CSV files
- Handled missing data
- Verified and cleaned transaction dates
- Conducted descriptive statistics
- Identified the month with the most sales
- Visualized data using bar charts
- Segmented customers into LRFM groups

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Findings

Customers can be segmented into five distinct LRFM groups:
- LRFM: Highly valuable customers with frequent, recent purchases and high spending
- lrFm: Low lifetime value, infrequent purchases, older purchases, low spending
- LRfm: High lifetime value, infrequent purchases, recent purchases, low spending
- lRfm: Low lifetime value, infrequent purchases, recent purchases, low spending
- lrfm: Least valuable customers with infrequent, older purchases and low spending

## Recommendations

- Focus on retaining LRFM customers through loyalty programs and special offers
- Improve customer experience to convert other segments to LRFM
- Develop targeted offers for lrFm and lrfm segments to increase their value
